Bug Fixes
#########
- Only :code:`.json` format files are loaded by the `load_network` method.
  Furthermore, it is checked whether a file is represented by a class
  available in the namespace via the :code:`@component_registry` decorator
  (`PR #536 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/536>`__).

Documentation
#############
- Update deprecated information on the indices of variables in the Jacobian of
  a :code:`UserDefinedEquation`
  (`PR #552 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/552>`__).
- A note has been added, that the component and connection labels in subsystems
  should be made unique. On top of that, most of the components module docs isn
  now testable (`PR #553 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/553>`__).
