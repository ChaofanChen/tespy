v0.7.9 - Under development
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

New Features
############
- Implement a new property for connections to report the phase of the fluid,
  i.e. :code:`"l"` for liquid, :code:`"tp"` for two-phase and :code:`"g"` for
  gaseous. The phase is only reported in subcritical pressure
  (`PR #592 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/592>`__).
- Implement the Baumann correlation for wet expansion in steamturbines. The
  feature is available in a new component class,
  :py:class:`tespy.components.turbomachinery.steam_turbine.SteamTurbine`. To
  use the feature check the documentation of the component class
  (`PR #602 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/602>`__).

Bug Fixes
#########
- Run the postprocessing only for a converged solution. Otherwise specified
  values on buses, components or connections may change to nonsense, because
  the calculation is based on not-converged results of the variables
  (`PR #609 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/609>`__).
