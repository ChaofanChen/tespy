v0.7.9 - Under development
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

New Features
############
- Implement a new property for connections to report the phase of the fluid,
  i.e. :code:`"l"` for liquid, :code:`"tp"` for two-phase and :code:`"g"` for
  gaseous. The phase is only reported in subcritical pressure
  (`PR #592 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/592>`__).
