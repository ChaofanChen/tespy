v0.8.0 - Under development
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

API Changes
###########
- The :code:`OptimizationProblem` implements the following changes:
  - The dtype for :code:`objective` has been changed to list. With a single
    element list, a single objective optimization is carried out. With lists
    containing more elements, multi-objective optimization will be carried out.
  - The function argument :code:`gen` of the :code:`run` method has been
    renamed to :code:`evo`. The same applies for the :code:`individuals`
    dataframe.
  - Your tespy model now needs to have a function :code:`get_objectives`
    instead of :code:`get_objective` and it must return a list of values.
  - The intermediate printing during optimization has been removed.

New Features
############
- Modify the :code:`OptimizationProblem` class to allow multi-objective
  optimization (`PR #610 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/610>`__).
