v0.8.0 - Under development
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

API breaking changes
####################
- Exporting or saving a network state to the filesystem will create a single
  :code:`json` file in the future, meaning you need to change the path to
  :code:`"export.json"`, for example. Also, you need to replace the
  :code:`design_path` and :code:`init_path` arguments for your networks to
  point to the respective json file. To transform an existing export or save
  state from the old API of v0.7, you can use the :code:`v07_to_v08_export` and
  the :code:`v07_to_v08_save` methods. They will return a dictionary with the
  respective data, which you can dump into a :code:`.json` file.

  This also breaks the API of the
  :py:meth:`tespy.networks.network_reader.load_network` method, meaning
  exported network data based on :code:`tespy<0.8` are not compatible with how
  :code:`tespy>=0.8` is handling the data. Use the described method above to
  adjust that. On top of that, instead of the :code:`load_network` method, use
  the :code:`from_json` class method to import networks in the future:

  .. code-block:: python

    >>> from tespy.networks import Network
    >>> from tespy.connections import Connection
    >>> from tespy.components import Source, Sink
    >>> nwk = Network()
    >>> so = Source("source")
    >>> si = Sink("sink")
    >>> c1 = Connection(so, "out1", si, "in1")
    >>> nwk.add_conns(c1)
    >>> data = nwk.export("tmp.json")
    >>> list(data.keys())
    ['Network', 'Connection', 'Component', 'Bus']
    >>> list(data["Component"])
    ['Source', 'Sink']
    >>> imported_nw = Network.from_json("tmp.json")

New Features
############
- The parameter for delta pressure (:code:`dp`) is now available on all
  components, that do feature the pressure ratio :code:`pr` parameter
  (`PR #628 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/628>`__).

  .. attention::

    Please note, that the :code:`dp` parameter follows the network unit
    specification for pressure. If your network unit is :code:`bar`, then the
    pressure drop will also use bar as unit.
