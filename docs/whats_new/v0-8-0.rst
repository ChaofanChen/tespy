v0.8.0 - Under development
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

New Features
############
- Implement a new property for connections to report the phase of the fluid,
  i.e. :code:`"l"` for liquid, :code:`"tp"` for two-phase and :code:`"g"` for
  gaseous. The phase is only reported in subcritical pressure
  (`PR #592 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/592>`__).
- Change the export of a :py:class:`tespy.networks.network.Network` instance to
  separate writing to the filesystem from creating the data to export. This
  breaks the API of the :py:meth:`tespy.networks.network_reader.load_network`
  method, meaning exported network data based on :code:`tespy<0.8` are not
  compatible with how :code:`tespy>=0.8` is handling the data
  (`PR #605 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/605>`__).

  .. code-block:: python

    >>> from tespy.networks import Network
    >>> from tespy.connections import Connection
    >>> from tespy.components import Source, Sink
    >>> nwk = Network()
    >>> so = Source("source")
    >>> si = Sink("sink")
    >>> c1 = Connection(so, "out1", si, "in1")
    >>> nwk.add_conns(c1)
    >>> data = nwk.export()
    >>> list(data.keys())
    ['Network', 'Connection', 'Component', 'Bus']
    >>> list(data["Component"])
    ['Source', 'Sink']
- The parameter for delta pressure (:code:`dp`) is now available on all
  components, that do feature the pressure ratio :code:`pr` parameter
  (`PR #628 <https://github.com/oemof/tespy/pull/628>`__).

  .. attention::

    Please note, that the :code:`dp` parameter follows the network unit
    specification for pressure. If your network unit is :code:`bar`, then the
    pressure drop will also use bar as unit.
